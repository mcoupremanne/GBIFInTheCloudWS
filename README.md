# GBIF In The Cloud Workshop 

*Materials from the GBIF in the Cloud worksop (2022-06-29, Belgian Biodiversity Platform)*


During this workshop, we explore different tools to manipulate GBIF data at different scales. It is aimed to last one full day, with a morning session focusing on small scale data using jupyter lab and an afternoon session focusing on big data using MS Azure Cloud computing.

**The structure of this rep is the following:**

* **Data:**

countains raw data used for the exercises (some can be downloaded from GBIF)

* **Presentations:**

countains presentation materials

* **Exercises:**

The exercises are shared between two mains sections:

 * **Small Data Section**
   * Limited amount of records (28.000)
   * Python Pandas exercises
 * **Big Data section**
   * Based on the full GBIF snapshot on Azure Databricks (>2 billions records)
   * SQL exercises
   * requires MS Azure accounts
   
Each section also include a a hands-on exercise on (RawGraph)[https://app.rawgraphs.io/]. Results are available based on an export of the class Insecta.


Soluces to exercises are given as raw files (notebooks and SQL that can be imported and run within MS Azure/Jupyter Lab) and HTML.
